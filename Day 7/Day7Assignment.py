# Assignment:
# Create a class of your choosing,
# or create a restaurant class using
# the code we made for a restaurant menu.

# If you don't know what to make, just look around.
# What in your environment can be thought of as an object?

# Your class must meet these requirements:
# 1. At least 3 attributes
# 2. At least 3 methods
# 3. Instantiate it at least once as an object to show that it works

# Good luck and let me know if you have any questions!
