# PROJECT: Create a number guessing game
# Use a while loop and if statements to make
# a guess-the-number game!
# You can manually set the number to be guessed (if you want)
# or, if you want, you can use the following code
# to set the number randomly:
import random
number = random.randint(int(input("Lower bound (inclusive): ")), int(input("Upper bound (inclusive):  ")))
# I'll explain what this code does if we have time in class
# otherwise, you can just use the code there

# Here are the requirements:
# 1. The computer tells the user whether the guess is higher or lower
# 2. The code uses while loops and if statements
# 3. The computer takes two numbers as inputs for upper and lower bounds

# If you finish this quickly and are looking for something a little more advanced, let me know!
# If you don't understand anything or you're struggling with this, send me any questions you have!
